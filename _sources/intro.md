# Tree sequence tutorials

**Welcome!**

This site contains a number of tutorials to develop your understanding of
[tree sequences](https://tskit.dev/learn.html#what) and software programs,
such as [msprime](https://tskit.dev/msprime), that use them.

If you are new to the world of tree sequences, we suggest you start with the
first tutorial: {ref}`sec_what_is`

We aim to be a friendly, welcoming open source community.
Questions and discussion about using {program}`tskit`, the tree sequence toolkit
should be directed to the
[GitHub discussion forum](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/discussions), and there are
similar forums for other software in the tree sequence [development community](https://github.com/tskit-dev),
such as for [msprime](https://github.com/tskit-dev/msprime/discussions) and
[tsinfer](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tsinfer/discussions).

:::{note}
Tutorials are under constant development. Those that are still a work in progress and
not yet ready for use are shown in _italics_ in the list of tutorials.

We very much welcome help developing existing tutorials or writing new ones. Please open
or contribute to a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tutorials/issues) if you
would like to help out.
